###Cellular Automata for Fluid Flow
- Note from Shiffman re: CA FlowFields:

Hi Jason,

Thanks for this e-mail, really interesting stuff! I wonder if you
should consider looking at CA [Cellular Automata] rules and applying them to flow fields,
i.e. a vector in a flow field’s state is its magnitude and/or
direction and its new state at each generation would be calculated as
a function of its neighbors.

This is an interesting idea for a Nature of Code exercise for my CA
chapter in fact.

I’ll think about this more and look forward to your thesis presentation!

Let me know if there’s anything else I can do to help,
Dan [Shiffman]
